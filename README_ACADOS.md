# Wind Farm Yaw Control with acados MPC

This package implements Model Predictive Control (MPC) for wind farm yaw optimization using both CasADi and acados solvers.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Basic dependencies
pip install numpy casadi py_wake matplotlib

# For acados (recommended for best performance)
# Follow: https://docs.acados.org/installation/
pip install acados_template
```

### 2. Run the demos

```bash
# CasADi-based MPC (QP with linearization)
python nmpc_windfarm.py

# acados-based MPC (requires acados installation)
python nmpc_windfarm_acados.py

# Compare both methods side-by-side
python compare_mpc_solvers.py
```

## Usage Example

```python
from nmpc_windfarm_acados import AcadosYawMPC, Farm, Wind, Limits, MPCConfig
import numpy as np

# Define 4-turbine row layout
D = 178.0  # DTU 10MW rotor diameter
x = np.array([0.0, 7*D, 14*D, 21*D])
y = np.zeros_like(x)
farm = Farm(x=x, y=y, D=D)

# Wind conditions
wind = Wind(U=8.0, theta=0.0)  # 8 m/s along +x axis

# Constraints
limits = Limits(
    yaw_min=-25,      # deg
    yaw_max=25,       # deg
    yaw_rate_max=0.3  # deg/s
)

# MPC configuration
cfg = MPCConfig(
    dt=10.0,          # sampling time [s]
    N_h=20,           # horizon length [steps]
    lam_move=0.5      # yaw rate penalty weight
)

# Create controller
controller = AcadosYawMPC(farm, wind, limits, cfg)

# Run for 50 steps
history = controller.run(n_steps=50, verbose=True)

# Results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([h['power']/1e6 for h in history])
plt.xlabel('Time step')
plt.ylabel('Farm Power [MW]')
plt.show()
```

## Performance

For a 4-turbine problem with 12-step horizon:

| Method | Avg Solve Time | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| CasADi QP | ~50ms | Good for prototyping |
| acados | ~10ms | **Recommended for deployment** |

acados is 3-5x faster and scales better to larger problems.

## Understanding the Approach

### Why Linearization?

Directly optimizing with PyWake in the loop is too slow for real-time control. Instead, we:

1. **Evaluate** current power P‚ÇÄ and gradient ‚àáP using PyWake
2. **Linearize** power around current point: P(œà) ‚âà P‚ÇÄ + ‚àáP^T(œà - œà‚ÇÄ)
3. **Solve** QP with linearized cost (very fast!)
4. **Apply** first control move
5. **Repeat** at next time step with updated linearization

This gives near-optimal performance with 10-100x faster solves than full nonlinear MPC.

### Delay Handling

Wake effects take time to propagate from upstream to downstream turbines:

```
œÑ·µ¢‚±º = floor(distance / (wind_speed √ó dt))  [steps]
```

We maintain a history buffer of past yaw angles and look up delayed values when computing power.

## Tuning Guide

### Horizon Length (N_h)
- **Longer**: Better optimization, captures more wake dynamics
- **Shorter**: Faster solves, less memory
- **Rule of thumb**: Cover 1-2 advection times through farm (~10-30 steps)

### Sampling Time (dt)
- **Larger**: Fewer solves needed, simpler
- **Smaller**: Better tracking, finer control
- **Rule of thumb**: 5-20 seconds (balance control frequency with turbine actuator bandwidth)

### Move Penalty (lam_move)
- **Larger**: Smoother yaw trajectories, less actuator wear
- **Smaller**: More aggressive optimization, higher power gains
- **Rule of thumb**: Start with 0.1-0.5, tune based on trade-off

## Troubleshooting

### acados installation issues

If `pip install acados_template` doesn't work:

1. Build from source: https://docs.acados.org/installation/
2. Make sure cmake, gcc, and Python development headers are installed
3. Check that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` includes acados lib directory

### Solver fails / returns status != 0

- Check initial guess is feasible (within bounds)
- Reduce horizon length
- Increase solver tolerances
- Try different QP solver (QPOASES vs HPIPM)

### Slow gradient computation

Gradient via finite differences requires 2N+1 PyWake evaluations (~1-2s for N=4).

**Solutions:**
- Compute gradients asynchronously in separate thread
- Use coarser finite difference step (eps=0.1 deg instead of 0.01)
- Pre-compute look-up table for common conditions
- Train neural network surrogate (see MPC_FORMULATION.md)

## Next Steps

1. **Read** `MPC_FORMULATION.md` for deep dive into the math and implementation details

2. **Experiment** with different farm layouts:
   ```python
   # Try different geometries
   x = np.array([...])  # your layout
   y = np.array([...])
   ```

3. **Tune** parameters for your use case

4. **Extend** with:
   - Time-varying wind (direction tracking)
   - Robust MPC (multiple wind scenarios)
   - Learning-based power surrogate
   - Multi-objective optimization (power + loads)

5. **Deploy**:
   ```python
   # Generate C code for embedded system
   ocp.code_export_directory = 'c_generated_code'
   solver = AcadosOcpSolver(ocp, generate=True, build=True)
   ```
