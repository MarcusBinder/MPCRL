# Wind Farm MPC Debugging Results

## Problem Summary

The MPC controller exhibited limit cycle oscillations, alternating between two yaw configurations with decreasing power:
```
t=00: œà=[ 6.7 -4.8 -6.1 -6.9], P=13.961 MW
t=01: œà=[-0.8  2.7  1.4  0.6], P=14.027 MW
t=02: œà=[ 6.7 -4.8 -6.1 -6.9], P=13.961 MW  ‚Üê Exact repeat!
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Test 1: Gradient Correctness ‚úÖ
**File**: `test_gradient_correctness.py`

**Finding**: Gradient computation is CORRECT
- At œà=[0,0,0,0]: gradient is exactly zero (stationary point)
- At non-zero yaws: gradient correctly points in power-increasing direction
- Gradient magnitude: ~0.008-0.028 MW/deg (reasonable)

**Conclusion**: The gradient is working properly.

---

### Test 2: Simple Gradient Ascent ‚ö†Ô∏è
**File**: `test_simple_gradient_ascent.py`

**Finding**: Even simple gradient ascent oscillates!
- System converges toward œà‚âà[0,0,0,0]
- Near zero, gradient becomes very small (~6.7e-4 MW/deg)
- Fixed step size causes oscillations around the zero-gradient point

**Conclusion**: Problem is NOT unique to MPC - it's fundamental to the objective function.

---

### Test 3: Adaptive Gradient Ascent ‚úÖ
**File**: `test_adaptive_gradient_ascent.py`

**Finding**: Line search achieves monotonic convergence
- Power increased from 14.017 ‚Üí 14.027 MW (+10.5 kW, +0.08%)
- Converged to œà ‚âà [0, 0, 0, 0]
- Final gradient: 1.19e-5 MW/deg (essentially zero)

**Conclusion**: œà=[0,0,0,0] is where gradient descent converges.

### Test 4: Search for Global Optimum üéØ
**File**: `test_search_for_optimum.py`

**CRITICAL FINDING**: œà=[0,0,0,0] IS THE GLOBAL MAXIMUM!

Power ranking:
1. **œà=[0,0,0,0]: 14.027 MW** ‚Üê BEST (baseline)
2. Demo state B: 14.013 MW (-14 kW)
8. **Demo state A: 13.813 MW (-214 kW)** ‚Üê MPC oscillating here!

**Key insights**:
- ALL non-zero yaw configurations DECREASE power
- MPC oscillates between rank #2 and rank #8 (both suboptimal)
- System is perfectly symmetric: P(+Œ∏) = P(-Œ∏)
- œà=0 is a local maximum (all directions decrease power)
- NO configuration achieves > 1% gain over aligned

---

## Why Is œà=[0,0,0,0] Optimal?

For a **straight-line layout** with turbines perfectly aligned with the wind:
- Wake steering provides NO benefit (no cross-wind separation to exploit)
- Yawing any turbine REDUCES its power capture (cosine loss)
- No downstream benefit compensates for this loss

**This layout cannot benefit from yaw optimization!**

---

## Why Does MPC Oscillate?

The MPC oscillations occur because:

1. **Flat objective**: œà=[0,0,0,0] is optimal but has zero gradient
2. **Numerical noise**: Small errors in gradient evaluation
3. **Low move penalty**: Œª=0.01-0.05 is TOO SMALL
4. **Large control authority**: Rate limit of 7.5¬∞/step allows big movements
5. **Successive linearization**: Linearization is inaccurate far from operating point

The cycle:
```
1. Start near œà=[0,0,0,0] (optimal)
2. Gradient is nearly zero + numerical noise
3. MPC says "move to improve power" (false signal from noise)
4. Low move penalty ‚Üí large movement allowed
5. End up at œà‚â†0 (WORSE power!)
6. Gradient now points back toward œà=0
7. MPC says "move back"
8. Overshoot to other side
9. Repeat forever (limit cycle)
```

---

## Solution

### Option 1: Increase Move Penalty (Recommended) ‚úÖ

**Increase Œª from 0.01-0.05 to 1.0-10.0**

This will:
- Keep system near œà=[0,0,0,0] where it should be
- Prevent wandering due to gradient noise
- Make small movements only when gradient is large
- Accept that œà=[0,0,0,0] is optimal

### Option 2: Add Deadband

Only optimize if:
```python
if |current_power - P_at_aligned| > threshold:
    run_MPC()
else:
    # Stay at aligned, don't optimize
    psi_next = np.zeros(N)
```

### Option 3: Don't Use Yaw Control

For this layout (straight line, aligned with wind):
- **Yaw control provides NO benefit**
- **Best strategy: Keep all turbines aligned (œà=0)**

Accept that this is the wrong layout for yaw optimization!

---

## Recommended Fix

Modify `nmpc_windfarm_acados_fixed.py`:

```python
# OLD:
cfg = MPCConfig(dt=15.0, N_h=20, lam_move=0.01)

# NEW:
cfg = MPCConfig(dt=15.0, N_h=20, lam_move=5.0)  # 500x larger!
```

This will:
- Heavily penalize movement away from current state
- Converge to œà=[0,0,0,0] and stay there
- Eliminate oscillations
- Accept ~zero power gain (which is correct for this layout!)

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test the gradient first**: Always verify gradient correctness before debugging optimization
2. **Understand the objective**: Know what the optimal solution SHOULD be
3. **Check for flat regions**: Flat objectives are hard to optimize
4. **Not all layouts benefit from yaw control**: Straight-line layouts get no benefit
5. **Move penalties matter**: Too small ‚Üí oscillations, too large ‚Üí no optimization

---

## For Future Work

If you want yaw optimization to actually provide benefit:

### Better Layout Options:
1. **Staggered grid**: Turbines not perfectly aligned
2. **Wind farm with varying wind directions**: Yaw can redirect wakes
3. **Closely spaced turbines**: Stronger wake interactions

### For This Layout:
- Accept œà=[0,0,0,0] is optimal
- Use MPC for other purposes (e.g., tracking changing wind)
- Or: Test with different wind angles (not 0¬∞)
