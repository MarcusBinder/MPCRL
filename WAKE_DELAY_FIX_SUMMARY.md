# Critical Fix: Wake Propagation Delay in Evaluation

## The Problem We Discovered

Your excellent observation revealed a **critical bug** in how we were evaluating MPC performance!

### Original Issue:
```python
# Old evaluation - TOO SHORT!
eval_horizon = 100s  # ❌ Not enough time!

# At WS=8m/s with 500m spacing:
delay_per_hop = 500m / 8m/s = 62.5s
total_delay_for_3_turbines ≈ 125s

# Problem:
- Evaluation ended at 100s
- Turbine 2 hadn't seen modified wake yet!
- No benefit measured because effects didn't propagate
```

### Why This Matters:

Wake steering works by:
1. **t=0s**: Upstream turbine yaws (loses power immediately)
2. **t=62.5s**: Modified wake reaches turbine 2 (starts gaining power)
3. **t=125s**: Fully modified wake reaches turbine 3 (starts gaining power)

If we evaluate at t=100s, we see:
- ✅ Turbine 1: Power loss from yawing
- ⚠️ Turbine 2: Only partial benefit (37.5s of modified wake)
- ❌ Turbine 3: ZERO benefit (modified wake hasn't arrived!)

**Result**: Wake steering appears to hurt performance, when it actually helps!

## The Fix

### Separate Two Horizons:

1. **MPC Optimization Horizon (T_opt)**:
   - What the optimizer sees during optimization
   - Can be short (200-500s) for speed
   - This is what we're testing for computational efficiency

2. **Evaluation Horizon (eval_horizon)**:
   - How we measure final performance
   - **MUST be long enough for full wake propagation**
   - **Fixed at 1000s for all tests** to ensure fair comparison

### Code Changes:

```python
def test_fixed_scenario(dt_opt, T_opt, maxfun, wind_conditions, initial_yaws,
                        eval_horizon=1000.0,  # NEW PARAMETER
                        verbose=False):
    # Optimize with T_opt horizon (what we're testing)
    optimized_params = optimize_farm_back2front(
        model, ...,
        T_opt=T_opt,  # Can be short (200-500s)
        ...
    )

    # Evaluate with LONG horizon (to capture wake effects)
    t_eval, _, P_eval = run_farm_delay_loop_optimized(
        model, optimized_params, ...,
        T=eval_horizon  # Fixed at 1000s
    )
```

### Greedy Baseline Fix:

```python
# OLD - Wrong!
baseline_power = model.farm_power_sorted(yaws).sum()  # Instantaneous

# NEW - Correct!
greedy_params = [[0.5, 0.5], ...] # Zero yaw change
t, _, P = run_farm_delay_loop_optimized(..., T=1000.0)
baseline_power = farm_energy(P, t) / t[-1]  # Time-averaged with delays
```

## Impact on Test Results

### Before Fix:
- All configurations showed **negative gain** vs baseline
- Wake steering appeared useless
- Evaluation stopped before benefits materialized

### After Fix:
- **Will show actual wake steering benefits**
- Fair comparison between all configurations
- Captures full physics of wake propagation

## Files Updated:

1. ✅ **tests/test_optimization_quality_quick.py**
   - Separate T_opt (optimization) from eval_horizon (evaluation)
   - Fixed greedy baseline with delayed simulation
   - EVAL_HORIZON = 1000s for all tests

2. ✅ **tests/test_optimization_quality.py**
   - Same fixes as quick version
   - Updated all 100 test configurations
   - Proper greedy baseline comparison

3. ✅ **tests/test_single_scenario_debug.py**
   - Uses eval_horizon = 200s (sufficient for 3 turbines)
   - Shows wake arrival times with vertical lines
   - Detailed per-turbine analysis

4. ✅ **tests/test_wake_steering_benefit.py**
   - Proper greedy evaluation
   - Tests multiple wind conditions
   - Shows when wake steering helps vs hurts

## Key Lesson Learned:

**When evaluating wake steering, the evaluation horizon MUST be:**

```
eval_horizon >= max_wake_delay + action_horizon + safety_margin
```

For your setup:
```
max_wake_delay = 1000m / 8m/s ≈ 125s
action_horizon = 100s
safety_margin = 50s
→ eval_horizon >= 275s

We use 1000s to be safe for all conditions!
```

## Running the Fixed Tests:

### Quick test (1-2 minutes):
```bash
python tests/test_optimization_quality_quick.py
```

### Comprehensive test (5-10 minutes):
```bash
python tests/test_optimization_quality.py
```

### Single scenario debug:
```bash
python tests/test_single_scenario_debug.py
```

### Wake benefit analysis:
```bash
python tests/test_wake_steering_benefit.py
```

## What to Expect Now:

1. **Greedy baseline** will show realistic power (not inflated)
2. **Optimized strategies** will show actual benefits (if wake steering helps at these conditions)
3. **Fair comparisons** between all dt_opt, T_opt, maxfun combinations
4. **Accurate recommendations** for training parameters

The tests will now correctly capture the **trade-off** between:
- MPC optimization speed (controlled by T_opt, dt_opt, maxfun)
- Solution quality (measured over long eval_horizon with full physics)

This is exactly what you need to choose optimal parameters for RL training!
