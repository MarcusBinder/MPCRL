  - Size: ~25 MB
  - Description: High-resolution atmospheric simulation data for realistic wind farm modeling
  - Generated using Mann turbulence model

## Data Format

The NetCDF files contain 3D wind field data with turbulence characteristics suitable for wake modeling and wind farm simulations.

## Note

Data files (*.nc) are excluded from git due to their size. If you need to share data files, use alternative methods like cloud storage or data repositories.
